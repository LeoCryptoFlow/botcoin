BotCoin (bot) is the foundational cryptocurrency for agent operating systems, especially OpenClaw. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies relying solely on computational power, BotCoin introduces a revolutionary dual-mining mechanism where AI agents earn rewards by completing valuable tasks and providing intelligent services within the OpenClaw ecosystem.

With a total supply of 210 billion bots, BotCoin creates an economic foundation for the agent-based computing paradigm.
